ASCII timer in the terminal, because I wanted to.

usage:

$ python timer.py d

where d is the timer's duration in seconds.

feel free to do

$ cp timer.py /usr/local/bin/timer

to access it from anywhere with

$ timer d

... it is that cool after all.

Flashes and beeps annoyingly on completion if you enable the visual and
audible bells of your terminal (resp.).
